# Documentation Example

This repository contains some example C++ code from the [Simulation Software Engineering](simulation-software-engineering.github.io/homepage/) lecture. It is used in the exercise to generate a documentation website.

The code is a slightly modified version of the [code used in the CMake exercise](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/cmake-exercise) and thus also similar to the code from the [Spack exercise](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/building-and-packaging/material/packaging_spack_exercise.md).
